  <title>de Rham Theorem</title>
  <p>
    The differential operator <m>d:\Lambda^p(M)\to\Lambda^{p+1}(M)</m> satisfies the relation <m>d^2=0</m>.
    Using this, we can define the de Rham cohomology groups as follows:
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let
        <md>
          <mrow>\amp  Z^k(M)=\{\omega\in\Lambda^k(M)\mid d\omega=0\},</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp B^k(M)=\{d\eta\mid \eta\in\Lambda^{k-1}(M)\}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then <m>B^k(M)\subset Z^k(M)</m>, and the quotient spaces
        <me>
          H_{DR}^k(M)=Z^k(M)/B^k(M)
        </me>,
        are called the de Rham cohomology groups.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    We have the following result
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <title>de Rham</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For any <m>k\geq 0</m>, we have
        <me>
          H_{DR}^k(M)=H_{sing}^k(M)
        </me>,
        where <m>H_{sing}^k(M)</m> is the singular cohomology groups.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      There are many fancy proofs of the above result.
      The proof provided below is the best one
      (and can be made rigorous).
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>S_k(M)</m> be the vector spaces generated by all dimension <m>k</m> submanifolds of <m>M</m> with boundaries.
      The map
      <me>
        \pa: S_k(M)\to S_{k-1}(M)
      </me>
      sends those submanifolds into their boundaries.
      Obviously, <m>\pa^2=0</m>.
      That is, the boundary of the boundary of a submanifold has no boundary.
      We can define the homology groups as
      <me>
        H_k(M)=\frac{\{V\mid \pa V=0,  V\in S_k(M)\}}{\{\pa W\mid W\in S_{k+1}(M)\}}
      </me>
      for all <m>k\geq 0</m>.
      We <em>assume</em> that
      <me>
        H_{sing}^k(M)=(H_k(M))^*
      </me>,
      which is a combinatorial result and the proof can be found in any book in algebraic topology.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a natural non-degenerated coupling between
      <m>\Lambda^k(M)</m> and <m>S_k(M)</m> by the integration
      <me>
        \Lambda^k(M)\times S_k(M)\to \mathbb R,\qquad (\omega,V)\mapsto \int_V\omega
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the Stokes theorem, the above coupling descends to the map
      <me>
        H^k_{DR}(M)\times H_k(M)\to\mathbb R
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To complete the proof,
      we need to prove that the above coupling is non-degenerated.
      What we need to prove is that,
      for any <m>p</m>-form <m>\omega</m> such that
      <m>d\omega=0</m> and for any <m>p</m>-dimensional submanifold <m>K</m> without boundary <m>\int_K\omega=0</m>,
      then there is a <m>p-1</m> form <m>\eta</m> such that <m>\omega=d\eta</m>.
      Let <m>U,V</m> be two open sets and suppose that the theorem is proved for <m>U,V</m>.
      Let <m>\omega=d\eta_1</m> on <m>U</m> and <m>\omega=d\eta_2</m> on <m>V</m>.
      Then on <m>U\cap V</m>, <m>d(\eta_1-\eta_2)=0</m>.
      We need to prove that for any <m>p-1</m> dimensional submanifold <m>L</m> in <m>U\cap V</m>,
      if <m>\int _L(\eta_1-\eta_2)=0</m>,
      then there is a <m>\xi</m> such that <m>\eta_1-\eta_2=d\xi</m>.
      Thus <m>\eta_1-d\xi=\eta_2</m> provides the required solution.
