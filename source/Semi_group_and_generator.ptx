  <title>Semigroup and its generator</title>
  <p>
    In this section,
    we define abstract semigroup and prove some of the basic properties.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A one-parameter semigroup on a complex Banach space
        <m>\mathcal B</m> is a family <m>T_t</m> of bounded linear operators,
        where <m>T_t: \mathcal B\to\mathcal B</m> parameterized by real numbers <m>t\geq 0</m> and satisfies the following relations:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>T_0=1</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If   <m>0\leq s,t\lt \infty</m>, then
              <me>
                T_sT_t=T_{s+t}
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The map
              <me>
                (t,f)\to T_tf
              </me>
              from <m>[0,\infty)\times\mathcal B</m> to
              <m>\mathcal B</m> is jointly continuous.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The (infinitesimal) generator <m>Z</m> of a one-parmeter semigroup <m>T_t</m> is defined by
    <me>
      Zf=\limt t^{-1}(T_tf-f)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The domain <m>{\mathcal Dom}(Z)</m> of <m>Z</m> being the set of <m>f</m> for which the limit exists.
    It is evident that <m>{\mathcal Dom}(Z)</m> is a linear space.
    Moreover, we have
  </p>
  <lemma>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The subspace <m>{\mathcal Dom}(Z)</m> is dense in <m>\mathcal B</m>,
        and is invariant under <m>T_t</m> in the sense that
        <me>
          T_t( {\mathcal Dom}(Z) )\subset  {\mathcal Dom}(Z)
        </me>
        for all <m>t\geq 0</m>.
        Moreover
        <me>
          T_tZf=ZT_t f
        </me>
        for all <m>f\in  {\mathcal Dom}(Z)</m> and <m>t\geq 0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </lemma>
  <proof>
    <p>
      If <m>f\in\mathcal B</m>, we define
      <me>
        f_t=\int_0^t T_xf\, dx
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above integration exists in the following sense:
      since <m>T_xf</m> is a continuous function of <m>x</m>,
      we can define the integration as the limit of the corresponding Riemann sums.
      In a Banach space,
      absolute convergence implies conditional convergence.
      Thus in order to prove the convergence of the Riemann sums,
      we only need to verify that
      <me>
        \int_0^t||T_xf||\, dx
      </me>
      is convergent.
      But this follows easily from the joint continuity in the definition of the semigroup:
      <m>||T_xf||</m> must be uniformly bounded for small <m>x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We compute
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp  \limh h^{-1} (T_hf_t-f_t)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\limh\left\{ h^{-1}\int_h^{t+h}T_xf dx-h^{-1}\int_0^t T_x f dx\right\}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\limh \left\{ h^{-1}\int_t^{t+h}T_x f dx-h^{-1}\int_0^h T_x f dx\right\}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =T_t f-f</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, <m>f_t\in{\mathcal Dom}(Z)</m> and
      <me>
        Z(f_t)=T_t f-f
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>t^{-1} f_t\to f</m> in norm as <m>t\to 0^+</m>,
      we see that <m>{\mathcal Dom}(Z)</m> is dense in <m>\mathcal B</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    The generator <m>Z</m>, in general,
    is not a bounded operator.
    However, we can prove the following
  </p>
  <lemma>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The generator <m>Z</m> is a closed operator.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </lemma>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We first observe that
      <me>
        T_tf-f=\int_0^t T_x Zf dx
      </me>
      for <m>f\in{\mathcal Dom}(Z)</m>.
      To see this,
      we consider the function <m>r(t)=T_tf-f-\int_0^t T_x Zf dx</m>.
      Obviously we have <m>r(0)=0</m> and <m>r'(t)\equiv 0</m>.
      Thus <m>r(t)\equiv 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>\{f_n\}</m> be a sequence in the domain of <m>Z</m> such that
      <m>f_n\to f</m> and <m>Zf_n\to g</m>.
      Using the above formula, we have
      <me>
        T_t f-f=\lim_{n\to \infty} (T_t f_n -f_n) =\lim_{n\to \infty}\int_0^t T_x Zf_n dx
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem,
      the above limit is equal to
      <me>
        \int_0^t T_x g dx
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we have
      <me>
        \limt t^{-1}(T_t f-f)=g
      </me>,
      and therefore, <m>f\in{\mathcal Dom}(Z), Zf=g</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <remark>
    <p>
      If <m>Z</m> is not a bounded operator on <m>{\mathcal Dom}(Z)</m>,
      it is not possible to extend <m>Z</m> to the whole banach space
      <m>\mathcal B</m> because otherwise since <m>Z</m> is closed,
      <m>Z</m> has to be bounded by the closed graph theorem.
    </p>
  </remark>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\mathfrak B</m> be a Hilbert space.
        If the operators <m>T_t</m> are self-adjoint operators,
        then <m>Z</m> is a densely defined self-adjoint operator.
      </p>
