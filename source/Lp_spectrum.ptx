            A one-parameter semi-group on a complex Banach space <m>B</m> is a family <m>T_t</m> of bounded linear operators,
            where <m>T_t: B\rightarrow B</m> parameterized by real numbers
            <m>t\geqslant 0</m> and satisfies the following relations:

                  If <m>0\leqslant s_1 t \lt  +\infty</m>, then
                  <me>
                    T_s T_t = T_{s+t}
                  </me>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <title>\ding{174}</title>
                <p>
                  The map
                  <me>
                    t_1 f \mapsto T_t f
                  </me>
                  from <m>[0, +\infty)\times B</m> to <m>B</m> is jointly continuous.

            </ul>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      <p>
        The (infinitesimal) generator <m>Z</m> of a one-parameter semi-group <m>T_t</m> is defined by
        <me>
          Zf = \lim_{t\rightarrow 0^+} t^{-1}(T_t f - f)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The domain <m>Dom(Z)</m> of <m>Z</m> being the set of <m>f</m> for which the limit exists.
        It is evident that <m>Dom(Z)</m> is a linear space.
        Moreover, we have
      </p>
      <lemma>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The subspace <m>Dom(Z)</m> is dense in <m>B</m>,
            and is invariant under <m>T_t</m> in the sense that
            <me>
              T_t(Dom(Z)) \subset Dom(Z)
            </me>
            for all <m>t\geqslant 0</m>.
            Moreover
            <me>
              T_t Zf = ZT_t f
            </me>
            for all <m>f\in Dom(Z)</m> and <m>t \geqslant 0</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </lemma>
      <proof>
        <p>
          If <m>f\in B</m>, we define
          <me>
            f_t = \int_0^t T_x fdx
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The above integration exists in the following sense:
          since <m>T_x f</m> is a continuous function of <m>x</m>,
          we can define the integration as the limit of the corresponding Riemann sums.
          In a Banach space,
          absolute convergence implies the conditional convergence.
          Thus in order to prove the convergence of the Riemann sums,
          we only need to verify that
          <me>
            \int_0^t \|T_x f\|dx
          </me>
          is convergent.
          But this follows easily from the joint continuity in the definition of semi-group.
          <m>\|T_x f\|</m> must be uniformly bounded for small <m>x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We compute
          <md>
            <mrow>\nonumber \amp  \amp  \lim_{h\rightarrow 0^+} h^{-1} (T_h f_t - f_t)</mrow>
            <mrow>\nonumber \amp  = \amp  \lim_{h\rightarrow 0^+}\left\{h^{-1}\int_h^{t+h} T_x fdx - h^{-1}\int_0^t T_xfdx\right\}</mrow>
            <mrow>\nonumber \amp  = \amp  \lim_{h\rightarrow 0^+}\left\{h^{-1}\int_t^{t+h} T_x fdx - h^{-1}\int_0^h T_xfdx\right\}</mrow>
            <mrow>\nonumber \amp  = \amp  T_t f - f</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, <m>f_t \in Dom(Z)</m> and
          <me>
            Z(f_t) = T_t f - f
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>t^{-1}f_t \rightarrow f</m> in norm as <m>t\rightarrow 0^+</m>,
          we see that <m>Dom(Z)</m> is dense in <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
      <p>
        The generator <m>Z</m>, in general,
        is not a bounded operator.
        However, we can prove the following
      </p>
      <lemma>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The generator <m>Z</m> is a closed operator.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </lemma>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We first observe that
          <me>
            T_t f - f = \int_0^t T_x Z f dx
          </me>
          if <m>f\in Dom(Z)</m>.
          To see this,
          we consider the function <m>r(t) = T_t f - f - \int_0^t T_x Zfdx</m>.
          Obviously we have <m>r(0) = 0</m>, and <m>r'(t)\equiv 0</m>.
          Thus <m>r(t)\equiv 0</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
      <p>
        Using the above formula, we have
        <me>
          T_f f - f = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(T_t f_n - f_n) = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_0^t T_x Z f_n dx
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        By the Lebegue theorem, the above limit is equal to
        <me>
          \int_0^t T_x g dx
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus we have
        <me>
          \lim_{t\rightarrow 0^+}t^{-1}(T_t f - f) = g
        </me>
        and therefore <m>f\in Dom(Z)</m>, <m>Zf = g</m>.
      </p>
      <lemma>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>B</m> is a Hilbert space,
            then <m>Z</m> must be densely defined and self-adjoint.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </lemma>
      <p>
        Let <m>M</m> be a manifold of dimension <m>n</m>,
        not necessarily compact or complete.
        The semi-group can formally be defined as
        <me>
          e^{\Delta t}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        More precisely, the following result is true
      </p>
      <theorem>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>M</m> be a manifold, then there is a heat kernel

            </me>
            such that
            <me>
              (T_t f)(x) = \int_M H(x,y,t)f(y)dy
            </me>

                  <m>H(x,y,t) = H(y,x,t)</m>.

                  <m>\lim_{t\rightarrow 0^+} H(x,y,t) = \delta_x(y)</m>.

            </ul>

        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        In [Getzler], the above theorem was proved.
        One of the feature of the above theorem is that the proof is independent to the fact that <m>\Delta</m> can be extended as a densely defined self-adjoint operator on <m>L^2(M)</m>.
        In particular, we don't need to assume <m>M</m> to be complete.
        The infinitesimal generator on <m>L^2(M)</m> is in fact the Dirichlet Laplacian.
      </p>
      <p>
        We let <m>\Delta_p</m> denote the Laplacian on <m>L^p</m> space.
        With this notation,
        for most of the theorems in linear differential geometry,
        the completeness assumption can be removed.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>f\in Dom(\Delta_2)</m> such that
            <m>f\in L^2(M)</m> and <m>\Delta f = 0</m>.
            Then <m>f</m> has to be a constant.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>
      <p>
        When <m>M</m> is a complete manifold,
        the above is a theorem of Yau.
        However, it is interesting to see that even when <m>M</m> is incomplete,
        the above result is still true,
        and the proof is exactly the same as the original proof of Yau.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examining some special cases of the above setting is interesting.

            <title>\textcircled{A}</title>
            <p>
              If <m>\partial M\neq \emptyset</m> and if
              <m>\partial M</m> is an <m>(n-1)</m>-dimensional manifold,
              then <m>A_2</m> is the Dirichlet Laplacian.
            </p>
          </li>

            <title>\textcircled{B}</title>
            <p>
              If <m>M = \mathbb{R}^n - \{0\}</m>.
              Then if <m>f\in L^2(M)</m>,
              <m>\Delta f = 0</m> and <m>f \in Dom(\Delta_2)</m>.
              Then <m>f(0) = 0</m> and <m>f</m> must be bounded near <m>0</m>.
              By the removable singularity theorem,
              <m>f</m> extends to a harmonic function on
              <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>, which must be a constant.
            </p>
          </li>

            <title>\textcircled{C}</title>
            <p>
              <m>\Delta_2</m> is particularly useful on moduli spaces,
              where it is very difficult to describe the boundary.

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Variational characterization of spectrum</title>
      <p>
        Unlike in the case of compact manifold, in general,
        a complete manifold doesn't admit any pure point spectrum.
        For example,
        there are no <m>L^2</m>-eigenvalues on <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>.
        That is, for any <m>\lambda\in\mathbb{R}</m>,
        if <m>\Delta f + \lambda f = 0</m> and <m>f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)</m>,
        then we have <m>f\equiv 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The above well-known result was generalized by Escobar,
        who proved that if <m>M</m> has a rotational symmetric metric,
        then there is no <m>L^2</m>-eigenvalue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>\Delta</m> be the Laplacian on a complete non-compact manifold <m>M</m>.
        By the argument in the previous section,
        <m>\Delta</m> naturally extends to a self-adjoint densely defined operator,
        which we still denote as <m>\Delta</m> for the sake of simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is well-known that there is a spectrum measure <m>E</m> such that
        <me>
          -\Delta = \int_0^{\infty} \lambda dE
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The heat kernel is defined as
        <me>
          e^{\Delta t}f(x) = \int H(x,y,t)f(y)dy
        </me>
        and the Green's function is defined as
        <me>
          G(x,y) = \int_0^\infty H(x,y,t)dt
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The pure-point spectrum of <m>\Delta</m> are these <m>\lambda\in\mathbb{R}</m> such that
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>\ding{172}</title>
            <p>
              There exists an <m>L^2</m> function <m>f\neq 0</m> such that
              <me>
                \Delta f + \lambda f = 0
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>\ding{173}</title>
            <p>
              The multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m> is finite.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>\ding{174}</title>
            <p>
              In a neighborhood of <m>\lambda_1</m> it is the only spectrum point.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We define
        <me>
          \rho(\Delta) = \{y\in\mathbb{R}|(\Delta-y)^{-1}\mbox{ is a bounded operator} \}
        </me>
        and we define <m>\sigma(\Delta) = \mathbb{R} - \rho(\Delta)</m> to be the spectrum of <m>\Delta</m>.
        From the above discussion,
        <m>\sigma(\Delta)</m> decomposes as the union of pure point spectrum,
        and the so-called essential spectrum, which is,
        by definition, the complement of the pure-point spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
        The set of the essential spectrum is denoted as <m>\sigma_{ess}(\Delta)</m>.
        Using the above definition, <m>\lambda\in\sigma_{ess}(\Delta)</m>,
        if either
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>\ding{172}</title>
            <p>
              <m>\lambda</m> is an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity, or
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>\ding{173}</title>
            <p>
              <m>\lambda</m> is the limiting point of <m>\sigma(\Delta)</m>.

          </li>
        </ul>

        The following theorems in functional analysis are well-known.

            there exists an infinite dimensional subspace <m>G_\varepsilon \subset Dom(A)</m>,

            where <m>K</m> is a compact set running through an exhaustion of the manifold.
            Then <m>\lambda_0</m> and <m>\lambda_{ess}</m> are the least lower bound of

          <p>
            If <m>\lambda_0 \lt \lambda_{ess}</m>,

        In this case, <m>\lambda_0</m> is called the ground state.

        In the following,
        we give a non-trivial application of the above principle.

        <title>Lin-Lu</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>M</m> be a complex complete surface embedded in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.
            Assume that <m>M</m> is not totally geodesic,
            but asymptotically flat in the sense that the second fundamental form goes to zero at infinity.
            Define
            <me>
              \Omega = \{y\in\mathbb{R}^3 | d(y,M) \leqslant a \}
            </me>
            for a small positive number <m>a > 0</m>.
            Then <m>\Omega</m> is a <m>3</m>-d manifold with boundary.
            The Dirichlet Laplacian of <m>\Omega</m> has a ground state.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        Sketch of the proof: Since <m>M</m> is asymptotically flat,
        at infinity
        <me>
          \Omega \approx M \times [-a, a]
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result
        <me>
          \lambda_{ess} = \frac{\pi^2}{4a^2}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus the main difficulty in the proof of the above theorem is to prove
        <me>
          \lambda_0 \lt  \frac{\pi^2}{4a^2}
        </me>
        which can be obtained by careful analysis of the Gauss and the mean curvatures.
      </p>
      <remark>
        <p>
          Exner <em>et al.</em> proved that under the condition
          <me>
            \int K \leqslant 0, \int |K| \lt  \infty
          </me>
          and <m>M</m> being asymptotically flat, the ground state exists.
          Thus we make the following conjecture to give the complete picture.
        </p>
      </remark>
      <conjecture>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be a complete, no-totally geodesic,
          and asymptotically embedded surface in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.
          Let <m>\Omega</m> be defined as before.
          Let <m>K</m> be the Gauss curvature.
          If
          <me>
            \int_M |K| \lt  +\infty
          </me>
          then the ground state exists.
        </p>
      </conjecture>
      <p>
        The difficulty of the above conjecture is that even the surface is asymptotically flat,
        we still don't known the long-range behavior of the surface.

    <title>On the theorem of Sturm</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>M</m>be a complete Riemannian manifold.
      We say that the volume <m>(M,g)</m> grows uniformly sub-exponentially,
      if for any <m>\varepsilon > 0</m>,
      there is a constant <m>C \lt  \infty</m> such that for all <m>r > 0</m> and all <m>x\in M</m>, we have
      <me>
        v(B_r(x))\leqslant Ce^{\varepsilon r}v(B_1(X))
      </me>
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>Sturm</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If the volume of <m>(M,g)</m> grows uniformly and sub-exponentially,
          then the spectrum <m>\sigma(\Delta_p)</m> of
          <m>\Delta_p</m> acting on <m>L^p(M)</m> is independent of <m>p\in[1, \infty)</m>.
          In particular, it is a subset of the real line.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      One feature of the concept
      <q>uniformly and sub-exponentially</q>
      is that it is self-dual.
      Take the following example: A hyperbolic space is not ``uniformly and sub-exponentially". On the other side,
      let <m>\Gamma</m> be a discrete group acting on the hyperbolic space <m>H</m>,
      such that <m>\Gamma\backslash H</m> has finite volume.
      Since the infinity of <m>\Gamma\backslash H</m> are cusps,
      it is still not
      <q>uniformly and sub-exponentially</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature satisfies the assumption that the volume grows
      <q>uniformly and sub-exponentially</q>. However, for such a manifold, its volume is infinite.
      It doesn't has the finite volume counterpart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof of Sturm's theorem depends on the heat kernel estimates.
      We begin with the following
    </p>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If the volume of <m>(M,g)</m> grows uniformly and sub-exponentially,
          then for any <m>\varepsilon > 0</m>
          <me>
            \sup_{x\in M}\int_M e^{-\varepsilon d(x,y)}(v(B_1(x))^{-\frac{1}{2}}v(B_1(y))^{-\frac{1}{2}} dv(y) \lt  \infty
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We take <m>r = d(x,y)</m>.
        Then since
        <me>
          B_1(y) \subset B_{r+1}(x)
        </me>
        we must have
        <me>
          v(B_1(y))^{-\frac{1}{2}} \geqslant v(B_{r+1}(x))^{-\frac{1}{2}} \geqslant Ce^{-\frac{1}{2}(r+1)}v(B_1(x))^{-\frac{1}{2}}
        </me>
        for any <m>x</m>.
        Thus the integration in the lemma is less than
        <me>
          C\int_M e^{-\varepsilon r}e^{\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon(r+1)} v(B_1(x))^{-1} dy
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We let <m>f(r) = v(\partial B_r(x))</m> and <m>F(r) = \int_0^r f(t)dt</m>.
        Then up to a constant, the above expression is less than
        <me>
          (v(B_1(x)))^{-1} \int_0^\infty e^{-\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon r} f(r)dr
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        By the volume growth assumption <m>f(r) \leqslant Cr^{n-1} v B_1(x)</m>,
        the lemma follows.
      </p>
    </proof>

      In fact, the assertion is true if

      The hard part is to prove <m>\sigma(\Delta_p) \subset \sigma(\Delta_2)</m> for all <m>p\in[1,\infty]</m>.
      If this is done, then it is easy to prove
      <me>
        \sigma(\Delta_2) \subset \sigma(\Delta_p)
      </me>
      as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>\xi\in\rho(\Delta_p)</m>.
      Then <m>(\Delta_p - \xi)^{-1}</m> is a bounded operator on <m>L^p(M)</m>.
      Let <m>\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1</m>.
      By dualization <m>(\Delta_q - \zeta)^{-1}</m> is bounded in <m>L^q(M)</m>.
      By the interpolation theorem,
      <m>(\Delta_2 - \zeta)^{-1}</m> is bounded and this <m>\zeta\in\rho(\Delta_2)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to prove <m>\sigma(\Delta_p)\subset\sigma(\Delta_2)</m>,
      or <m>\rho(\Delta_2)\subset\rho(\Delta_p)</m>, we need some estimates.
      Let <m>\zeta\in\rho(\Delta_2)</m>.
      Then
      <me>
        (\Delta_2 - \zeta)^{-1}
      </me>
      is bounded from <m>L^2 \rightarrow L^2</m>.
      In order to prove that the operator is bounded on <m>L^p</m>,
      we need to prove that it has a kernel <m>g(x,y)</m> such that
      <me>
        (\Delta_2 - \zeta)^{-n} f = \int g(x,y)f(y)dy
      </me>
    </p>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>g(x,y)</m> satisfies
          <me>
            \sup_{x\in M}\int_M |g(x,y)|dy \leqslant C
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then <m>(\Delta_2 - \zeta)^{-n}</m> is a bounded operator on <m>L^p(M)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        This is essentially H&#xf6;lder inequality:

          <mrow>\nonumber \amp  \amp  \int_M \left(\int_M g(x,y)f(y)dy\right)^p dx</mrow>

      If we assume that <m>\sigma(\Delta_p)</m> is a no-where dense set in <m>\mathbb{C}</m>,
      then we have
    </p>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>(\Delta_2 - \zeta)^{-n}</m> is bounded,
          so is <m>(\Delta_2 - \zeta)^{-1}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        For any <m>\varepsilon</m>,
        let <m>\zeta '\in\rho(\Delta_\rho)</m> and <m>|\zeta - \zeta '| \lt  \varepsilon</m>.
        Then from
        <me>
          \|(\Delta_2 - \zeta)^{-n}\| \leqslant C
        </me>
        we get
        <me>
          \|(\Delta_2 - \zeta ')^{-n}\| \leqslant C+1
        </me>
        provided that <m>\varepsilon</m> is small enough.
        Let <m>dist(\zeta ', \sigma(\Delta_p))</m> be the distance to the spectrum of <m>\Delta_p</m>,
        then we have
        <me>
          C+1 \geqslant \lim_{m\rightarrow \infty} \|(\Delta_2 - \zeta)^{-nm}\|^{\frac{1}{m}} \geqslant dist(\zeta ', \sigma(\Delta_p))^{-n}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus
        <me>
          dist(\zeta ', \sigma(\Delta_p)) \geqslant \frac{1}{(C+1)^{\frac{1}{n}}}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\zeta '</m> is arbitrary,
        we have <m>dist(\zeta, \sigma(\Delta_p)) > \delta > 0</m>.
