  <title>Formal Hodge Theorem</title>
  <p>
    The de Rham Theorem introduced in the last section is among the very fundamental results of compact manifolds.
    However, in terms of the concrete computation of the cohomology groups,
    they are not very efficient.
    The elements of the groups are classes of differential forms.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Hodge Theorem provides the way to pick up the best possible candidates in the classes.
    It asserts that, among the class of the form <m>\omega+d\eta</m>,
    there is a unique representative,
    called the <em>harmonic form</em>,
    which is better than other representatives of the class in the following sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    We consider the following variational problem for a fixed element <m>[a]</m> of <m>\Lambda^p(M)</m>:
    finding an <m>\eta_0</m> such that
    <men xml:id="x2-1">
      ||\eta_0||^2 =\underset{\eta\in[a]}{ inf}\,\int_X\langle\eta,\eta\rangle dV_g
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    By definition, each <m>\eta\in [a]</m> can be represented by
    <me>
      \eta=\xi_0+d\xi_1
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the space of <m>\xi_1</m> were of finite dimensional,
    then since <m>||\eta||^2\geq 0</m>,
    we could have found a <m>\xi_1'</m> such that
    <me>
      ||\xi_0+d\xi_1'||^2=\underset{\eta\in[a]}{ inf} ||\eta||^2
    </me>,
    and the variational problem<nbsp/><xref ref="x2-1"/> would have been solved.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now let's <em>assume</em> that there is a unique <m>p</m> form <m>\eta_0</m> that solves problem<nbsp/><xref ref="x2-1"/>.
    Let <m>\xi_1</m> be an arbitrary <m>p-1</m> form.
    Then we have the inequality
    <me>
      ||\eta_0+\eps d\xi_1||^2\geq||\eta_0||^2
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since <m>\eps</m> is arbitrary, we have
    <me>
      (\eta_0,d\xi_1)=0
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then
    <men xml:id="x2-2">
      \delta\eta_0=0
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then from<nbsp/><xref ref="x2-2"/>,
    <m>\eta_0</m> is harmonic, i.e., <m>\Delta\eta_0=0</m>.
    Thus the solution of the problem<nbsp/><xref ref="x2-1"/> must be harmonic.
    For any element <m>\eta</m> in a fixed cohomologyical class <m>[a]</m>,
    we have the following Hodge decomposition
    <me>
      \eta=\eta_0+d \eta_1
    </me>,
    where <m>\eta_0</m> is the harmonic form,
    and <m>\eta_1</m> is a <m>p-1</m> form.
    In general, for arbitrary <m>p</m> form <m>\eta</m>,
    we have the following Hodge decomposition:
    <me>
      \eta=\eta_0+d\xi_1+\delta\xi_2
    </me>,
    where <m>\eta_0</m>, <m>\xi_1</m>,
    and <m>\xi_2</m> are smooth <m>p</m>, <m>p-1</m>,
    and <m>p+1</m> forms, respectively,
    and <m>\eta_0</m> is harmonic.
