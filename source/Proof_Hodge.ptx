  <title>Proof of the Hodge Theorem</title>
  <p>
    The proof of the (real) Hodge theorem heavily depends on the analysis of the Laplacian <m>\Delta</m>.
    The three basic PDE tools we are going to use are the Sobolev Lemma,
    the Rellich Lemma, and the Garding inequality.
    For the first two lemmas, we need to introduce the Sobolev <m>s</m>-norms.
    The proof of the Garding inequality depends on the Weitzenb&#xf6;ck formula.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>M</m> be a compact Riemannian manifold.
    <m>X=\bigcup U_\alpha</m> be a finite cover such that each
    <m>(U_\alpha, \{x_\alpha^1,\cdots,
    x^{n}_\alpha\})</m> is a real local coordinate system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>\{\rho_\alpha\}</m> be the partition of unity subordinating to the cover <m>\{U_\alpha\}</m>.
    Let <m>S</m> be a smooth function.
    For any nonnegative integer <m>s</m>,
    define the Sobolev norm of <m>S</m> to be
    <me>
      \|S\|_s^2=\sum_\alpha\sum_{|K|\leq s}\int_M |D_\alpha^K (\rho_\alpha S)|^2 dV_M
    </me>,
    where <m>K=(k_1,\cdots,k_{n})</m> is the multiple index;
    <m>|K|=\sum k_i</m>; and
    <me>
      D_\alpha^K S=\frac{\pa^{k_1+\cdots+k_{n}}}{ \pa (x_\alpha^1)^{k_1}\cdots \pa (x_\alpha^{n})^{k_{n}}} S
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Obviously, the definition of the Sobolev norms depend on the choice of the cover
    <m>\{U_\alpha\}</m> and the partition of unity <m>\{\rho_\alpha\}</m>.
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that the Sobolev norms <m>||||_s</m>,
        defined by different covers and partitions of unity, are equivalent.
        In particular,
        the norm <m>\|\|_0</m> is equivalent to the <m>L^2</m> inner product in<nbsp/><xref ref="p-3"/>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    There is a way to generalize the notation of Sobolev norms <m>||||_s</m> from nonnegative integers <m>s</m> to any nonnegative numbers <m>s</m>,
    using pseudo-differential operators, or using the
    <q>elementary</q>
    definition as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    We first define the Sobolev <m>s</m>-norms for
    <m>\rho_\alpha S</m> on each <m>U_\alpha</m>.
    Since <m>U_\alpha</m> is a coordinate patch,
    we can assume, without loss of generality,
    that <m>U_\alpha</m> is an open set of a torus <m>T=T_{n}=\R^{n}/\Z^{n}</m>.
    Thus the section <m>\rho_\alpha S</m> can be extended as a smooth <m>\C^r</m>-valued function on <m>T</m>.
    Let
    <me>
      \rho_\alpha S=\sum_{\xi\in\mathbb Z^{n}}S_\xi e^{i\langle\xi,x\rangle}
    </me>
    be the Fourier expansion of <m>S_\alpha</m>.
    We define
    <me>
      ||\rho_\alpha S||_s^2=\sum_{\xi\in\mathbb Z^{n}}(1+||\xi||^2)^s |(\rho_\alpha S)_\xi|^2
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Sobolev <m>s</m>-norm of <m>S</m> is defined as
    <me>
      ||S||_s^2=\sum_\alpha||\rho_\alpha S||_s^2
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Define <m>\mathcal H_s^{p}(M)</m> to be the completion of the smooth <m>p</m>-forms under the norm <m>||||_s</m>.
    As before, it is independent of the choice of the cover and the partition of unity.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <title>Sobolev Lemma</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
            <idx><h>Sobolev lemma</h></idx>
        Using the above notations, we have
        <me>
          \underset{s}{\bigcap}\,\mathcal H^{p}_s(M)=\Lambda^{p}(M)
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      The theorem being local,
      we assume that <m>S</m> is a <m>\C^r</m>-valued smooth function of <m>T</m>.
      By definition, for any <m>s>0</m>, we have
      <me>
        \sum_{\xi\in \mathbb Z^{n}} (1+||\xi||^2)^s |S_\xi|^2\leq C \lt \infty
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>K=(k_1,\cdots,k_{n})</m> be a multiple index.
      We consider the Fourier expansion of
      <me>
        D^K S\sim \sum_{\xi\in \mathbb Z^{n}} (i)^{|K|}\xi_1^{k_1}\cdots\xi_{n}^{k_{n}} S_\xi e^{i\langle\xi,x\rangle}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By definition, if <m>S\in\bigcap_s \mathcal H^{p}_s(M)</m>, then
      <me>
        \sum_{\xi\in \mathbb Z^n} |\xi_1^{k_1}\cdots \xi_{n}^{k_{n}}|^2 |S_\xi|^2\leq  \sum_{\xi\in \mathbb Z^{n}} (1+||\xi||^2)^s |S_\xi|^2\lt +\infty
      </me>
      for any <m>K</m>.
      Thus <m>D^K S</m> is well-defined.
      Since the differential operators <m>D^K</m> are closed operators,
      we conclude that <m>S</m> is <m>K</m> differentiable and hence prove the result.

    In order to prove the Rellich Lemma,
    we give the following definition of
    <em>compact operators</em>.
        <idx><h>compact operator</h></idx>
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\mathcal B_1,\mathcal B_2</m> be two Banach spaces.
        Let <m>A: \mathcal B_1\rightarrow\mathcal B_2</m> be a linear operator from
        <m>\mathcal B_1</m> to <m>\mathcal B_2</m>.
        <m>A</m> is a compact operator,
        if the image of the unit ball of
        <m>\mathcal B_1</m> under <m>T</m> is sequential compact in <m>\mathcal B_2</m>.
        In other word,
        if <m>\{x_i\}</m> is a bounded sequence of <m>\mathcal B_1</m>,
        then a subsequence of <m>\{Ax_i\}</m> converges to some point of <m>\mathcal B_2</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The following is the basic fact about a self-adjoin compact operator.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\mathcal H</m> be a Hilbert space and let
        <m>A: \mathcal H\to\mathcal H</m> be a compact operator.
        Then the essential spectrum <m>\sigma_{ ess}(A)\subset\{0\}</m>.
        Moreover, if <m>\sigma_{ ess}(A)=\emptyset</m>,
        then <m>\mathcal H</m> is the direct sum of eigenspaces of each non-zero eigenvalues, that is,
        if <m>E_m</m> is the eigenspaces of the eigenvalue <m>\lambda_m</m>.
        Then we have
        <me>
          \mathcal H=\bigoplus_m E_m
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      If <m>\lambda\in\sigma_{rm ess}(A)</m> and <m>\lambda\neq 0</m>.
      Then for any <m>\eps>0</m>, by the Weyl's criterion,
      there exists an infinite dimensional vector space <m>G_\eps</m> such that for any <m>\phi\in G_\eps</m>, we have
      <me>
        \|A\phi-\lambda\phi\|\lt \eps
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We choose an orthonormal set <m>\{\phi_i\}\subset G_\eps</m>.
      Since <m>A</m> is compact, we may assume that <m>A\phi_i</m> is convergent.
      Assume that for <m>i,j</m> big enough but <m>i\neq j</m>, we have
      <me>
        \|A\phi_i-A\phi_j\|\leq \eps
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we have
      <me>
        \lambda\|\phi_i-\phi_j\|\leq \|A(\phi_i-\phi_j)\|+\|A\phi_i-\lambda\phi_i\|+\|A\phi_j-\lambda\phi_j\|\leq 3\eps
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>\phi\perp\phi_j</m>,
      we have <m>\|\phi_i-\phi_j\|=\sqrt 2</m>.
      Thus we have a contradiction
      <me>
        \sqrt 2\,\lambda\leq 3\eps
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proves the first part of the theorem.
      If <m>\sigma_{ ess}(A)=\emptyset</m>,
      then is follows from the spectrum theorem that the whole space is the direct sum of the eigenspaces.

      Similar to the previous theorem,
      we can work on a torus <m>T</m>.
      Assume that <m>\{ u_k\}</m> is a bounded sequence of <m>\mathcal H^{p}_s(T)</m>.
      We wish to prove that a subsequence of <m>\{u_k\}</m> will converge in the <m>|| ||_r</m> norm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>\{(u_k)_\xi\}</m> be the Fourier coefficients of <m>u_k</m> for <m>k\geq 1</m>.
      Then
      <men xml:id="x2-5">
        \sum_{\xi\in \mathbb Z^{n}} (1+||\xi||^2)^s |(u_k)_\xi|^2\leq C
      </men>
      for some constant <m>C</m> independent of <m>k</m>.
      For any fixed <m>\xi</m>,
      a subsequence of <m>(1+||\xi||^2)^{s/2} (u_k)_\xi</m> converges.
      By the standard diagonalization,
      we can find a subsequence of <m>\{u_k\}</m>,
      which we still denote as <m>\{u_k\}</m> for abusing of notations,
      such that for each <m>\xi</m>,
      <m>(1+|| \xi||^2)^{s/2} (u_k)_\xi</m> is convergent.
    </p>
    <p>
      We prove that <m>\{u_k\}</m> is a Cauchy sequence under the normal <m>||||_r</m>.
      For any <m>\eps>0</m>, we choose <m>R</m> large so that
      <men xml:id="x2-26">
        \frac{1}{(1+R^2)^{s-r}}\lt \eps
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We consider all <m>\xi</m> with <m>||\xi||\leq R</m>.
      There are only finitely many such <m>\xi</m>'s.
      By the assumption on the sequence <m>\{u_k\}</m>,
      there is an <m>N>0</m>, such that
      <me>
        \sum_{||\xi||\leq R} (1+||\xi||^2)^r |(u_k)_\xi-(u_l)_\xi|^2\lt \eps
      </me>
      for <m>k,l>N</m>.
      Thus we have
      <me>
        ||u_k-u_l||_r^2\leq\eps+\sum_{||\xi||>R} (1+||\xi||^2)^r |(u_k)_\xi-(u_l)_\xi|^2

    The standard method in proving the above theorem,
    like in that of the Rellich Lemma,
    is to use the diagonal subsequence method, which is widely used.
    In the following, we give a different proof,
    using the Tychonoff Theorem.
  </p>
  <p>
    We consider <m>F(M)</m>,
    the space of all bounded functions with bound <m>1</m> on <m>M</m>.
    By the identification
    <me>
      F(M)=\prod_{x\in M}\mathbb [-1,1]
    </me>,
    and by the Tychonoff Theorem,
    we know that <m>F(M)</m> is compact under the product topology.
    On the other hand, on <m>\mathcal C^0(M)</m>,
    we can define the so-called compact-open topology,
    whose subbase composed of the set of the form
    <me>
      C(K,U)=\{f\mid F(K)\subset U\}
    </me>,
    where <m>K</m> is a compact subset of <m>M</m> and <m>U</m> is an open set of <m>\mathbb R</m>.
    We can prove that when we restrict to the space <m>\mathcal C^1(M)</m>,
    the product topology is the same as the compact-open topology.
    On the other hand, on <m>\mathcal C^0(M)</m>,
    compact-open topology defines the same topology as in the Banach space <m>\mathcal C^0(M)</m>,
    and the theorem is proved.

    Next we shall introduce the Garding inequality.
    Let
    <me>
      \phi,\psi\in\Gamma(X,\Lambda^p(M))
    </me>,
    and let
    <me>
      \mathfrak D (\phi,\psi)=(\phi,\psi) +(d\phi, d\psi)+(\delta\phi, \delta\psi)=(\phi, (1+\Delta)\psi)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then <m>\mathfrak D(\phi,\psi)</m> defines an inner product on <m>\Lambda^p(M)</m>.
    Apparently we have the inequality
    <me>
      \mathfrak D(\phi,\phi)\leq C||\phi||_1^2
    </me>
    for some constant <m>C</m>.
    The Garding inequality states that the inverse inequality is also true so that the norms
    <m>\sqrt{\mathfrak D(\phi,\phi)}</m> and <m>||\phi||_1</m> are equivalent.

  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      The proof of the inequality depends on the Weitzenb&#xf6;ck formula,
      <xref ref="thm6">Theorem</xref>.
      Let <m>\phi\in\Lambda^p(M)</m>.
      Then
      <men>
        \Delta\phi=-\nabla^*\nabla\phi+E(\phi)
      </men>,
      where <m>E</m> is a zero-th differential operator.
      Using integration by parts, we get
      <me>
        (\Delta\phi,\phi)\geq\int|\nabla\phi|^2-C(\phi,\phi)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows that
      <me>
        \mathfrak D(\phi,\phi)\geq (\phi,\phi)+\frac{1}{2C}(\Delta\phi,\phi)\geq \frac{1}{2C}\int|\nabla\phi|^2+\frac 12 (\phi,\phi)
      </me>,
      and the inequality is proved.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <proof>
    <p>
      For <m>\phi\in\Lambda^p(M)</m>,
      we define a linear functional
      <me>
        l(\psi)=(\phi,\psi)
      </me>
      for <m>\psi\in\Lambda^p(M)</m>.
      With respect to the inner product
      <m>\mathfrak D(\phi,\psi)</m>, <m>l</m> is bounded:
      <me>
        |l(\psi)|\leq ||\phi||_0\sqrt{\mathfrak D(\psi,\psi)}

    </p>
    <p>
      Thus by the Riesz representation theorem,
      there is an <m>\eta</m> such that

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>(\phi,\psi)=(\eta, (1+\Delta)\psi)</m> for any <m>\psi\in\Gamma(X,\mathcal A^{p,q}(E))</m>;

      Let <m>A: \Lambda^p(M)\rightarrow\Lambda^p(M)</m> be the linear operator defined by sending
      <m>\phi\in\Lambda^p(M)</m> to the unique <m>\eta</m> defined above.
      Since <m>A</m> is a bounded operator,
      it can be extended to an operator on <m>L^2(M)</m>.
      Then since <m>\eta</m> is actually in <m>\mathcal H^{p}(M)</m>,
      the operator <m>A</m> is a compact operator by the Rellich Lemma.
      On the other hand,
      it is not hard to see that <m>A</m> is a self-adjoint operator\footnote {Since <m>A</m> is a bounded operator,
      in order to prove that <m>A</m> is self-adjoint,
      we just need to verify the equality
      <m>(A\phi,\psi)=(\phi,A\psi)</m> for smooth <m>\phi</m> and <m>\psi</m>,
      which follows easily from integration by parts.}.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the spectral theorem for compact,
      self-adjoint operators, there is a Hilbert-space decomposition
      <me>
        \Lambda^p(M)=\bigoplus_m E(\rho_m)
      </me>,
      where <m>\rho_m</m> are the eigenvalues of <m>A</m> and
      <m>E(\rho_m)</m> are the finite-dimensional eigenspaces corresponding to the eigenvalue <m>\rho_m</m>.
      Since <m>A</m> is one-to-one, all <m>\rho_m\neq 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We claim that
      <me>
        \mathcal H^p(M)=E(1)
      </me>,
      where <m>\mathcal H^{p}(M)</m> is the space of harmonic forms.
      To see this, we assume that
      <m>\phi\in\mathcal H^{p}(M)</m>, and <m>A\phi=\phi</m>.
      By the Weitzenb&#xf6;ck formula,
      <m>\Delta</m> is an elliptic operator.
      Using the Sobolev Lemma and Schauder estimate,
      we can prove that <m>\phi</m> is smooth.
      Thus <m>(1+\Delta)\phi=\phi</m> and <m>\phi</m> is harmonic.
      Since <m>E(1)</m> is of finite dimensional, we have
      <me>
        \dim\,\mathcal H^{p}(M)\lt +\infty
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proves the first assertion of the theorem.
      To prove the second assertion of the theorem,
      we note that the biggest possible eigenvalue of <m>A</m> is <m>1</m>.
      By the property of compact operators,
      there is a gap between the eigenvalue <m>1</m> and the rest of the eigenvalues.
      Thus if <m>\phi\in\mathcal H^{p}(M)^\perp</m> and if <m>\phi</m> is smooth, we have
      <me>
        ||\Delta\phi||_0\geq\eps||\phi||_0
      </me>
      for some <m>\eps>0</m>.
      Thus we can define the inverse operator <m>G</m> on <m>\mathcal H^{p}(M)^\perp</m>,
      called the Green's operator,
      such that <m>G=\Delta^{-1}|_{\mathcal H^{p}(M)^\perp}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we compare <m>G</m> to the operator <m>A</m>
      (they have the same eigenspaces),
      we shall see that <m>G</m> is also a compact operator because
      <m>||G||\leq C||A||</m> for some constant <m>C</m>.
      Furthermore, by the elliptic regularity,
      <m>G</m> maps smooth <m>p</m>-forms to smooth <m>p</m> forms.
      Using this fact, the Hodge decomposition is given by
      <me>
        \phi=\eta_0+d\delta G\phi+\delta dG\phi
      </me>.

      This completes the proof of the Hodge Theorem.
