  <title>Self-adjoint extension of the Laplace operator</title>
  <p>
    In this section, we assume that <m>M</m> is Riemannian manifold,
    not necessarily compact nor complete.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>\Lambda^p(M)</m> be the space of smooth <m>p</m>-forms and let
    <m>L^2(\Lambda^p(M))</m> be the metric space completion of
    <m>\Lambda^p(M)</m> under the inner product product defined in <nbsp/><xref ref="p-3"/>.
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that we can identify
        <m>L^2(\Lambda^p(M))</m> to be the space of <m>p</m>-forms <m>\omega</m>, where
        <me>
          \omega=a_{i_1\cdots i_p}\omega_{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge\omega_{i_p}
        </me>,
        such that <m>a_{i_1\cdots i_p}</m> are locally <m>L^2</m> integrable functions.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    The reason we would like to use
    <m>L^2(\Lambda^p(M))</m> in stead of <m>\Lambda^p(M)</m> is,
    of course,
    that <m>L^2(\Lambda^p(M))</m> is complete,
    allowing many applications in analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, it is not possible to extend <m>\Delta</m> to
    <m>L^2(\Lambda^p(M))</m> as a symmetric linear operator.
    In what follows, we briefly explain the reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, the Laplace operator is not a bounded operator on <m>\Lambda^p(M)</m>.
    We can give counterexamples even in one-dimensional case:
    let <m>f</m> be a smooth function on <m>[0,1]</m>.
    Then there doesn't exist a constant <m>C</m> such that
    <me>
      \int_0^1(f''(t))^2 dt\leq C\int_0^1(f(t))^2 dt
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, like most differential operators,
    the Laplace operator is a closed-graph operator.
    That is, if <m>\eta_j\to \eta</m> and
    <m>\Delta\eta_j\to\eta'</m> in <m>L^2</m> and <m>\eta\in\Lambda^p(M)</m>,
    then we must have <m>\eta'=\Delta\eta</m>.
    To see this,
    we consider any smooth <m>p</m> form <m>\omega</m>: We have
    <me>
      \int\langle\eta'-\Delta\eta,\omega\rangle=\lim_{j\to\infty}\int \langle\Delta\eta_j,\omega\rangle-\lim_{j\to\infty}\int\langle\eta_j,\Delta\omega\rangle=0
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus we have <m>\eta'=\Delta\eta</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>\Delta</m> could be extended to a linear operator of <m>L^2(\Lambda^p(M))</m>,
    then by the <em>Closed Graph Theorem</em>,
    <m>\Delta</m> could have been bounded, which is a contradiction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of the above result,
    the best we can do is to extend the Laplacian operator into a
    <em>densely defined</em> self-adjoint operator.
    Of course, <m>\Lambda^p(M)</m> is dense in <m>L^2(\Lambda^p(M))</m>.
    But for such an operator (i.e, <m>\Delta</m> and its domain <m>{\mathcal Dom}(\Delta))</m>,
    we don't have the so-called spectral theorem.
    So in order to get meaningful results,
    we have to extend the Laplace operator first.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>H</m> be a Hilbert space, Given a densely defined linear operator <m>A</m> on <m>H</m>,
        its adjoint <m>A^*</m> is defined as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The domain <m>{\mathcal Dom}(A^*)</m> of <m>A^*</m> consists of vectors <m>x</m> in <m>H</m> such that
              <me>
                y\mapsto \langle x, Ay\rangle
              </me>
              is a bounded linear functional,
              where <m>y\in{\mathcal Dom}(A)</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              By the <em>Riesz Representation Theorem</em> for linear functionals,
              if <m>x</m> is in the domain of <m>A^*</m>,
              there is a unique vector <m>z</m> in <m>H</m> such that
              <me>
                \langle x,Ay\rangle=\langle z,y\rangle
              </me>
              for any <m>y\in {\mathcal Dom}(A)</m>.
              This vector <m>z</m> is defined to be <m>A^*x</m>.
              It can be shown that the dependence of <m>z</m> on <m>x</m> is linear.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>A^*=A</m> (which implies that <m>{\mathcal Dom}\, (A^*)={\mathcal Dom}\,(A)</m>),
        then <m>A</m> is called self-adjoint.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    For a (densely-defined) self-adjoint operator <m>A</m>,
    we have the <em>Spectral Theorem</em>.
    That is, there is a spectral measure such that
    <me>
      A=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\lambda dE
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A densely defined self-adjoint operator
    <m>\bar\Delta</m> is called an extension of <m>\Delta</m>,
    if <m>{\mathcal Dom}\, (\Delta)\subset {\mathcal Dom}\, (\bar\Delta)</m>, and
    <me>
      \Delta=\bar\Delta\,|_{{\mathcal Dom}\, (\Delta)}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the rest of the section, we shall study the extensions of <m>\Delta</m>.
    We shall prove that the extension of <m>\Delta</m> always exists,
    but in general,
    they are not unique in general.
  </p>
  <p>
    Define <m>H^1(M)</m> to be the Sobolev space of the completion of <m>\Lambda^p(M)</m> under the norm
    <me>
      ||\eta||_1=\sqrt{\int_M|\eta|^2 dV_M}+\sqrt{\int_M|\nabla\eta|^2\, dV_M}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, let <m>\Lambda_0^p(M)</m> be the space of smooth <m>p</m>-forms with compact support and define
    <m>H_0^1(M)</m> to be the Sobolev space of the completion of
    <m>\Lambda_0^p(M)</m> under the above norm.
    Then we have
    <me>
      H_0^1(M)\subset H^1(M)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, the above two spaces are not equal.
    However, we have

  <theorem xml:id="thm7">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>M</m> is a complete Riemannian manifold, then

      Let <m>\phi\in H^1(M)</m>.
      Then there exists a sequence <m>\{\phi_j\}\in \Lambda^p(M)</m> such that
      <me>
        \phi_j\to \phi, j\to\infty
      </me>
      in the <m>\|\|_1</m> norm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>p\in M</m> be a fixed point and let <m>\rho</m> be a smooth function on
      <m>\mathbb R</m> with compact support such that in a neighborhood of <m>0</m>,
      <m>\rho</m> is the constant <m>1</m>.
      Let <m>d(x,y)</m> be the distance function.
      Define

        \rho_j(x)=\rho(j^{-1}\,d(p,x))
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we can prove that

  <lemma>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Using the above notations, we have

          {\mathcal Dom}(\bar\Delta)={\mathcal Dom}(\bar\Delta^*)
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </lemma>
  <proof>
    <p>
      For any <m>\phi,\psi\in{\mathcal Dom}(\bar\Delta)</m>,
      <m>(\bar\Delta\phi,\psi)=Q(\psi,\phi)=(\phi,\bar\Delta\psi)</m> is a bounded functional.
      Thus <m>\phi\in {\mathcal Dom}(\bar\Delta^*)</m>.
      On the other hand, if <m>\phi\in {\mathcal Dom}(\Delta^*)</m>,
      then the functional <m>\psi\mapsto (\Delta\psi,\phi)</m> is bounded.
      By the Riesz representation theorem,
      there is a unique <m>f\in L^2(\Lambda^p(M))</m> such that <m>(\bar\Delta\psi,\phi)=(f,\psi)</m>.
      Thus we must have <m>Q(\phi,\psi)=(\bar\Delta\psi,\phi)=(f,\psi)</m>,
      and <m>\phi\in {\mathcal Dom}(\bar\Delta)</m>.

        The Laplace operator has a self-adjoint extension.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>M</m> be a complete Riemannian manifold.
        Then the extension of the Laplace operator is unique.

    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>\Delta_2</m> be another self-adjoint extension of <m>\Delta</m>.
      Then for <m>\phi\in {\mathcal Dom}(\bar\Delta)</m> the functional
      <me>
        \psi\mapsto(\phi,\Delta\psi)+(\phi,\psi)=(\Delta_2\phi,\psi)+(\phi,\psi)
      </me>
      for <m>\psi\in\Lambda_0^p(M)</m> is bounded under the norm <m>\|\|_1</m>.
      By <xref ref="prop1">Proposition</xref>,
      it is also bounded under the norm
      <me>
        \sqrt{Q(\cdot,\cdot)+(\cdot,\cdot)}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the Riesz representation theorem,
      there exists an element <m>\mu\in H^1(M)</m> such that
      <me>
        (\phi,\Delta\psi)+(\phi,\psi)=Q(\mu,\psi)+(\mu,\psi)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore <m>\phi=\psi\in H^1(M)</m>.
      Since <m>M</m> is complete, By <xref ref="thm7">Theorem</xref>,
      <m>\phi\in H_0^1(M)</m>.
      For any <m>\psi\in\Lambda_0^p(M)</m>, we have
      <me>
        (\Delta_2\phi,\psi)=(\phi,\Delta\psi)=Q(\phi,\psi)
      </me>
      and by taking limit,
      the above equality is also true for any <m>\psi\in H_0^1(M)</m>.
      Thus we prove
      <me>
        {\mathcal Dom}\,(\Delta_2)\subset {\mathcal Dom}\,(\bar\Delta)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hands, since both <m>\bar\Delta</m> and
      <m>\Delta_2</m> are self-adjoint, we have
      <me>
        {\mathcal Dom}\,(\bar\Delta)={\mathcal Dom}\,(\bar\Delta^*)\subset{\mathcal Dom}\,(\Delta_2^*)={\mathcal Dom}\,(\Delta_2)
      </me>,
      and thus we prove
      <me>
        {\mathcal Dom}\,(\bar\Delta)={\mathcal Dom}\,(\Delta_2)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus <m>\Delta_2=\bar\Delta</m>,
      and the extension is unique.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    In general, the self-adjoint extension is not unique.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>M</m> be a compact orientable manifold with smooth boundary.
        Let <m>\mathcal C_0^\infty(M)</m> be the space of smooth functions whose supports are within the interior of <m>M</m>,
        and let <m>\mathcal C^\infty(M)</m> be the space of smooth functions
        (smooth up to the boundary).
        We can define two kinds of Laplacians:
        the first one <m>\Delta_D</m> is called the Dirichlet Laplacian,
        which is the same as the Friedrichs extension <m>\bar\Delta</m>.
        The second one <m>\Delta_N</m> is called the Neumann Laplacian,
        defined by
        <md>
          <mrow>\amp {\mathcal Dom}(\Delta_N)=\left\{\phi\in H^1(M)\mid\right.</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \left.\forall\psi\in \mathcal C^\infty(M) \,\,s.t. \frac{\pa\psi}{\pa n}=0, \exists f\in L^2(M), s.t.\, Q(\phi,\psi)=( f,\psi)\right\}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <m>\phi,\psi\in \mathcal C^\infty(M)</m>,
        we have the Green's formula
        <me>
          (\Delta\phi,\psi)=\int_{\pa M}\frac{\pa\phi}{\pa n}\,\psi-\int_M\phi\,\frac{\pa\psi}{\pa n}+(\phi,\Delta\psi)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, if <m>\phi\in {\mathcal Dom}(\Delta_D)\cap\mathcal C^\infty(M)</m>,
        we have <m>\phi|_{\pa M}=0</m>,
        and if <m>\phi\in{\mathcal Dom}(\Delta_N)\cap \mathcal C^\infty(M)</m>,
        we have <m>\frac{\pa\phi}{\pa n}=0</m>.
        These justify the names.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Many results related to the Laplace operator are true even on noncomplete manifolds.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f\in { ker}\,(\bar\Delta)</m>.
        Assume that <m>f\in L^2(M)</m>.
        Then <m>f</m> is a constant.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    This is a theorem of Yau in the case of complete manifold.
    But we shall prove that it is also true for any noncompete manifold.
  </p>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>\rho_j</m> be the smooth function defined in <xref ref="thm7">Theorem</xref>.
      Then we have
      <me>
        0=(\bar\Delta f, \rho_j^2 f)=Q(f,\rho_j^2 f)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we have
      <me>
        \int_M\rho_j^2|\nabla f|^2=-2\int_M \rho_j\, f\nabla\rho_j\nabla f\leq 2\sqrt{\int_M|\nabla \rho_j|^2 f^2\, dV_M} \cdot\sqrt{\int_M\rho_j^2|\nabla f|^2\, dV_M}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows that
      <me>
        \int_M\rho_j^2|\nabla f|^2\,dV_M\leq \frac{C}{j^2}\int_Mf^2\, dV_M\to 0
      </me>
      and the theorem is proved.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>M=\mathbb R^n-\{0\}</m>.
        Then any <m>L^2</m> harmonic function extends to the origin.
        Thus by the theorem of Yau, we know that it has to be a constant.
        Let <m>M</m> be a bounded domain.
        Then the fact that <m>f</m> is in the domain of the Laplace operator implies that <m>f</m> vanishes on the boundary.
        Hence <m>f</m> is zero.
